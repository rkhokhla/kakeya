# CLAUDE_PHASE6.md — Autonomous Ops, Strong Guarantees, and Enterprise Proof

> **Audience:** `claude-code`, maintainers, SRE, Security, Compliance, GTM
> **Goal:** Build on Phase-5’s production implementation to deliver **autonomous operations**, **stronger consistency & provability**, and **enterprise integrations**—turning our hallucination-limiting verification layer into a turnkey, audit-ready platform for regulated customers. Phase-5 shipped CRR, cold tier, async audits, migration tooling, and SDK compatibility with SLOs held; Phase-6 automates, hardens, and proves it.

---

## 0) TL;DR (What Phase-6 delivers)

* **Autonomous reliability:** a **Kubernetes Operator** that orchestrates shard migrations, CRR, and tiering policies end-to-end (plan→canary→rollback) from runbooks into code.
* **Stronger consistency & geo control:** **selective/multi-way CRR**, divergence auto-healing, and tunable RPO/RTO per tenant/region; richer replication SLIs beyond the p95≤60s baseline.
* **Enterprise audit & compliance:** real-time **SIEM streaming**, **automated compliance reports** (SOC2/ISO binders), and **cost-aware blockchain/timestamp anchoring**.
* **Adaptive tiering:** predictive promotion/demotion to cut cold-hit latency and storage cost while keeping p95 verify≤200 ms and cold≤500 ms SLOs.
* **SDK expansion & hard guarantees:** Rust/WASM SDKs + **formal specs** (TLA+ for CRR idempotency; Coq lemmas for canonical signing) to prevent drift and strengthen investor/regulator confidence.
* **Hallucination risk dashboards for buyers:** investor-grade KPIs that tie trust gating to cost & quality outcomes in production.

## 1) Why now (investor lens)

The pitch promises **measurable hallucination reduction** and **governed scale**. Phase-5 proved the core (CRR, tiering, async audits, migration CLI) with new SLOs: CRR lag p95≤60s, cold tier p95≤500 ms, audit backlog p99<1 h, all while keeping verify p95≤200 ms. Phase-6 converts this into **autonomous**, **provable**, and **auditable** operations—exactly what enterprise buyers and security/compliance teams require before broad rollout.

---

## 2) Scope & Non-Goals

### In

1. **Operator-driven migrations & CRR** (dedup-migrate orchestration; policy-based CRR selection; safe rollbacks).
2. **Advanced CRR** (multi-way; per-tenant selective replication; improved divergence detection → **auto-reconcile** when safe).
3. **Enterprise audit** (real-time SIEM, automated compliance reports, optimized anchoring).
4. **Predictive tiering** (ML-driven pre-warm/promote; cost/latency optimizers).
5. **SDKs & formalization** (Rust/WASM SDKs; TLA+ & Coq artifacts).
6. **Product KPIs & buyer dashboards** connecting **hallucination containment** to $$ and quality.

### Out (Phase-7+)

* Full linearizability across regions; deep ML anomaly models; full external certification audits (we prepare binders here).

---

## 3) Deliverables (Definition of Done)

1. **Fractal Operator (K8s CRDs)**

    * CRDs: `ShardMigration`, `CRRPolicy`, `TieringPolicy`.
    * Automates `plan→copy→verify→dual-write→cutover→cleanup` with backpressure, health gates, and **auto-rollback** on SLO burn—codifying Phase-5 CLI/runbooks.
    * Emits events/metrics; integrates with Prometheus/Grafana.

2. **Advanced CRR**

    * **Selective** (per-tenant/namespace) and **multi-way** replication; configurable ship intervals and priorities.
    * Divergence detector evolves to **reconcile**: safe replays, quorum checks, and operator-approved fixes; richer SLIs beyond current p95≤60 s.

3. **Audit & Compliance**

    * **SIEM streams** (Splunk/Datadog) for WORM events, anchoring, divergence, and escalations.
    * **Automated reports**: monthly SOC/ISO-style PDFs (pulling Phase-5 batch-anchoring and backlog metrics).
    * **Anchoring optimizer**: choose blockchain/timestamp vs internal based on policy & cost.

4. **Predictive Tiering**

    * Access-pattern model to **pre-warm** warm tier, lowering cold-hit p95 while keeping cold cost wins; respects Phase-5 SLOs (cold p95≤500 ms).

5. **SDKs & Formal Proof Seeds**

    * **Rust** SDK (zero-copy) and **WASM** SDK (browser agents) with golden-vector parity (as in Phase-5 suite).
    * **TLA+** spec for CRR idempotent replay; **Coq** lemmas for canonical JSON & 9-dp rounding stability.

6. **Hallucination Impact Dashboards**

    * Productized views: **containment rate**, **cost per trusted task**, **trust-gated retries/RAG**, mapped to investor pitch claims.

## 4) Work Packages (WP) & key tasks

### WP1 — **Operator for Migrations & CRR**

* Implement CRDs/Controllers: `ShardMigration`, `CRRPolicy`, `TieringPolicy`.
* Controllers invoke Phase-5 **`dedup-migrate`** phases and CRR toggles; add health gates (latency, error budget, dedup-hit ratio) and **automatic rollback**.
* E2E tests: simulate shard growth 1→3→5 with cutover; verify zero downtime & idempotency.

### WP2 — **Advanced CRR & Auto-Reconcile**

* Add **per-tenant** routing and **N-region** topologies.
* Extend divergence checker to propose/apply safe **replays**; escalate only if conflicts exceed thresholds. Builds on Phase-5 divergence metrics.

### WP3 — **Enterprise Audit Integrations**

* **SIEM**: stream WORM/attest/CRR/divergence events.
* **Report generator**: scheduled tasks producing SOC/ISO-style binders from Phase-5 audit/anchoring data.
* Anchoring policy engine: choose blockchain vs timestamp; batch sizing to control gas/time.

### WP4 — **Predictive Tiering**

* Feature engineering on key access logs; **pre-warm** hot/warm proactively.
* Guardrails: never violate p95 verify≤200 ms and cold p95≤500 ms; publish cost/latency diffs.

### WP5 — **SDKs & Formalization**

* **Rust** and **WASM** SDKs with the same golden-vector harness used for Py/Go/TS parity in Phase-5.
* TLA+ model of CRR replay order & idempotency; Coq snippets proving canonicalization invariants.

### WP6 — **Buyer Dashboards & KPIs**

* Productized panels for: Hallucination Containment, Cost/Trusted Task, RTO/RPO, Replication Lag, Cold-hit rate, Audit Backlog. Wire to alerts from Phase-5.

## 5) Acceptance Criteria

* **Ops autonomy:** Operator can complete a full shard migration and CRR policy change **without manual steps**, including rollback on SLO burn. (Encodes Phase-5 CLI/runbooks.)
* **Geo control:** Per-tenant selective CRR enabled; multi-way topologies pass divergence tests; observed lag keeps or improves on p95≤60 s under nominal load.
* **Audit & SIEM:** Real-time streams present; monthly reports generated; anchoring policy reduces cost/time while preserving attestability created in Phase-5.
* **Tiering gains:** Reduced cold-hit p95 without regressing verify p95≤200 ms and cold p95≤500 ms; cost dashboard shows net savings.
* **SDK parity:** Rust/WASM pass golden vectors along with Py/Go/TS (Phase-5 framework).
* **Pitch-aligned KPIs:** Dashboards quantify fewer hallucination-driven escalations vs cost, ready for customer and investor review.

---

## 6) CI/CD Plan

Pipelines extend Phase-5 suites (golden vectors, geo-DR, chaos):

* `operator-unit` & `operator-e2e`: CRD reconciliation, failure injection, rollback paths.
* `crr-adv-e2e`: selective + multi-way replication; forced divergences with **auto-reconcile** checks.
* `siem-integration`: contract tests for streaming payloads.
* `tiering-ml-ab`: A/B comparison of cold-hit p95 & storage cost.
* `sdk-rust-wasm-golden`: parity with Phase-5 vectors.
* `formal-build`: compile TLA+/Coq artifacts (smoke tests).
* `perf-regression`: enforce existing SLO gates (verify p95≤200 ms; cold p95≤500 ms; backlog p99<1 h; CRR lag p95≤60 s).

Artifacts: CRD examples, operator logs, CRR policy diffs, SIEM samples, compliance PDFs, TLA+/Coq proofs, A/B cost-latency reports.

## 7) Milestones (6–8 weeks suggested)

1. **M1 (Week 1–2):** Operator MVP (ShardMigration CRD) + Rust SDK skeleton + SIEM schema.
2. **M2 (Week 3–4):** Advanced CRR (selective/multi-way) + divergence **auto-reconcile** + WASM SDK parity tests.
3. **M3 (Week 5–6):** Predictive tiering + compliance report generator + anchoring optimizer.
4. **M4 (Week 7–8):** Hardening & chaos drills; formal artifacts; buyer dashboards; release notes.

---

## 8) Risks & Mitigations

* **Operator mis-reconciliation** → dry-run mode, tight health gates, and one-click rollback; mirrors Phase-5 CLI steps.
* **Auto-reconcile false fixes** → “propose then apply” workflow; human-approved for critical divergences.
* **Predictive tiering regressions** → shadow mode, budget caps, and A/B SLO gates tied to existing p95 targets.
* **SDK drift** → shared golden vectors (Phase-5), semver policy, CI publish checks.
* **Compliance claims** → reports are evidence-backed from Phase-5 audit & anchoring data.

---

## 9) How this advances the hallucination promise

* **Fewer escapes:** operator-enforced SLO and policy gates keep “low-trust” generations in safe lanes automatically.
* **Faster truth:** selective CRR + pre-warm reduces wait to **verify** evidence; async audits keep deep checks off the hot path (Phase-5).
* **Provable safety:** formal specs and attestations increase buyer confidence that **verification happens before action**—even under failure and scale.

---

## 10) References

* **Phase-5 Implementation Report** — shipped CRR, cold tier, async audit, migration CLI, cross-shard ops, SDK golden tests, and new SLOs (CRR lag p95≤60 s, cold p95≤500 ms, backlog p99<1 h). These are the floor for Phase-6 autonomy and proof.
