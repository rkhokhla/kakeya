**🔬 Seeking Honest Peer Review: Formal Verification for LLM Output Quality**

I've spent the past months working on a formal verification system that provides mathematical guarantees for detecting LLM hallucinations without human-in-the-loop. The approach uses multi-scale geometric analysis (fractal dimension, directional coherence, compressibility) with constructive proofs via induction.

**📄 The preprint is ready, and I need your critical eyes:**

**arXiv Preprint (peer review ready):**
- PDF: https://github.com/rkhokhla/kakeya/blob/main/docs/architecture/arxiv-preprint.pdf
- Markdown: https://github.com/rkhokhla/kakeya/blob/main/docs/architecture/arxiv-preprint.md

**📊 Key claims I'm making (please verify):**
- **97.5% accuracy** detecting hallucinations vs 82-91% for baselines
- **18ms p95 latency** vs 120-250ms for RAG/self-consistency
- **Mathematical guarantees** via Hoeffding bounds (28.1% error bound for n=3 signals)
- **Four formal theorems** with constructive inductive proofs

**🧪 What I'm specifically asking for:**

1. **Mathematical rigor**: Are the proofs sound? (Theorems 1-4 in Section 5)
2. **Experimental validity**: Are the results reproducible? (Section 7)
3. **Baseline comparisons**: Are my comparisons fair? (Table 1)
4. **Limitations**: What am I missing? (Section 8)
5. **Related work**: What citations did I miss? (Section 2)

**🛠️ Full implementation available:**
- Complete codebase: https://github.com/rkhokhla/kakeya
- Implementation reports: https://github.com/rkhokhla/kakeya/blob/main/PHASE10_REPORT.md
- Formal verification code: https://github.com/rkhokhla/kakeya/blob/main/backend/internal/verify/bounds.go
- Test suite (48 tests passing): https://github.com/rkhokhla/kakeya/tree/main/tests

**🎯 Why I'm posting this publicly:**

I believe academic rigor requires honest scrutiny before arXiv submission. If you spot errors, invalid assumptions, or overclaimed results—**please call them out**. I'd rather fix issues now than publish flawed work.

**📬 How you can help:**
- Read the preprint (especially Sections 5-8)
- Check the math (Theorems 1-4)
- Run the code (instructions in README)
- Comment with feedback (technical criticism welcomed)
- Share with colleagues who work in formal verification, ML robustness, or LLM evaluation

**🙏 Special call-out to:**
- Researchers in **formal methods** & **program verification**
- Experts in **fractal analysis** & **geometric measure theory**
- Anyone working on **LLM hallucination detection**
- **Peer reviewers** from NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, FAccT, Oakland

If you find fatal flaws, I'll acknowledge you in the revision. If the work holds up, I'll submit to arXiv and conferences with confidence.

**Honest feedback > polite silence.**

**P.S.** If you're wondering "is this too good to be true?" — that's exactly the skepticism I'm looking for. Please verify the claims with the same rigor you'd apply to your own work.

**P.P.S.** This is an open-source project (MIT license). If the approach is sound, anyone can use it. If it's flawed, the community deserves to know.
