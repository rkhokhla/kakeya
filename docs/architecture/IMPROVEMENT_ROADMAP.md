# ASV Paper Improvement Roadmap
## Strategic Plan for Strengthening Empirical Impact & Industrial Relevance

**Created**: 2025-10-25
**Goal**: Elevate paper from "Strong Accept" to "Best Paper Award" quality with measurable real-world impact

---

## Current Status Assessment

### ‚úÖ What We Have (Strong)
1. **Perfect structural degeneracy detection** (r_LZ AUROC 1.000)
2. **Validated coverage guarantees** (Œ¥=0.05: empirical 0.0450 ‚úì)
3. **Signal ablation study** (shows r_LZ is critical, perplexity fails)
4. **Honest assessment** (admits factuality benchmarks were wrong task)
5. **Production-ready code** (48 tests passing, Go backend + Python agent)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è What's Missing (Gaps)
1. **No real-world deployment validation** (all results on academic benchmarks)
2. **Scale sensitivity used heuristics** (not actual N_j recomputation)
3. **No cost-benefit analysis** ($/decision, latency breakdown, ROI)
4. **No comparison to production systems** (GPT-4 judge, Guardrails AI, LangSmith)
5. **No human evaluation** (do users care about structural degeneracy?)
6. **Limited edge case analysis** (adversarial attacks, distribution shift)
7. **No integration study** (how hard to deploy? what breaks?)

## Phase 1: Quick Wins (1-2 weeks) üèÉ

### Priority 1.1: Fix Scale Sensitivity with Real Recomputation ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE (Unexpected but valuable findings)

**Why**: Reviewers will flag the heuristic as a limitation. Fix it now.

**What We Did**:
1. ‚úÖ Loaded pre-computed N_j from signal files (correct approach, not box-counting)
2. ‚úÖ Tested 8 scale configurations on 937 degeneracy samples
3. ‚úÖ Analyzed DÃÇ sensitivity to scale choice
4. ‚úÖ Discovered DÃÇ is NOT discriminative for degeneracy (AUROC 0.21)

**Key Finding**: **Scale configuration doesn't matter because DÃÇ doesn't contribute to degeneracy detection.** The perfect AUROC (0.9999977) comes entirely from **r_LZ (compressibility)**, which is scale-independent.

**Results**:
- k=2 [2,4]: AUROC 0.7351 (highest for DÃÇ, but produces negative values)
- k=5 [2,4,8,16,32]: AUROC 0.2558 (current default)
- **DÃÇ alone** (all scales): AUROC 0.2089 (worse than random!)
- **r_LZ alone**: AUROC 0.9999977 (perfect detection)

**Interpretation**: This is actually GOOD news - the system is robust because the dominant signal (r_LZ) is insensitive to parameter choices. Optimizing DÃÇ scale configuration is wasted effort.

**Validation Criteria** (Revised):
- ‚ùå ~~AUROC results match or improve current best~~ (DÃÇ doesn't matter for degeneracy)
- ‚úÖ Variance trends analyzed (k=2 is noisier but irrelevant)
- ‚è≠Ô∏è ~~Bootstrap CIs~~ (skipped - not meaningful for non-discriminative signal)

**Files Generated**:
- `scripts/analyze_scale_sensitivity_v3.py` (correct implementation)
- `results/scale_sensitivity/scale_sensitivity_corrected_results.csv`
- `docs/architecture/figures/scale_sensitivity_corrected.png`
- `docs/architecture/SCALE_SENSITIVITY_FINDINGS.md` (comprehensive analysis)

**Actual Effort**: 0.5 days (revealed limitation, not optimization opportunity)

**Lesson**: Empirical validation can contradict design intent - that's science! Document honestly and move to high-impact work.

---

### Priority 1.2: Latency & Cost Breakdown ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Why**: Production adoption depends on cost-effectiveness. Quantify it.

**Plan**:
1. Profile end-to-end verification latency (DÃÇ, coh‚òÖ, r_LZ, conformal)
2. Measure p50/p95/p99 for each component on degeneracy benchmark
3. Compute cost per verification ($0.0001 compute estimate from GPT-2 embeddings)
4. Compare to baseline costs (GPT-4 judge: ~$0.02/verification)

**Validation Criteria**:
- ‚úì Total p95 latency ‚â§ 50ms (meets production SLO)
- ‚úì Cost per verification ‚â§ $0.001 (100x cheaper than GPT-4 judge)
- ‚úì r_LZ is fastest signal (<5ms for 768-dim embeddings)

**Estimated Effort**: 1 day

**Deliverable**: New Section 6.4 "Performance Characteristics" with Table 10

---

### Priority 1.3: Human Evaluation on Structural Degeneracy ‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Why**: Validate that detected "degeneracies" are actually bad outputs humans care about.

**Plan**:
1. Sample 100 outputs: 50 ASV-flagged (high r_LZ score), 50 ASV-passed (low score)
2. Recruit 3 human raters (use Mechanical Turk or team members)
3. Ask: "Is this output structurally degenerate? (loops/repetition/drift/incoherence)"
4. Compute inter-rater agreement (Fleiss' kappa) and correlation with ASV scores

**Validation Criteria**:
- ‚úì Inter-rater agreement Œ∫ ‚â• 0.6 (substantial agreement)
- ‚úì Human labels correlate with ASV scores (Spearman œÅ ‚â• 0.7)
- ‚úì Precision ‚â• 0.8 (flagged outputs are truly bad)

**Estimated Effort**: 2 days (1 day setup, 1 day annotation + analysis)

**Deliverable**: New Section 6.5 "Human Evaluation" with Table 11

---

## Phase 2: Competitive Analysis (1 week) üèÜ

### Priority 2.1: Baseline Comparison to Production Systems ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Why**: Reviewers will ask "how does this compare to GPT-4 as judge?" Answer it.

**Plan**:
1. Implement 3 production baselines on degeneracy benchmark:
   - **GPT-4 judge**: Prompt GPT-4 to detect loops/repetition (via OpenAI API)
   - **SelfCheckGPT**: Sampling-based consistency check (open-source)
   - **Perplexity threshold**: Simple rule-based (our current baseline)
2. Measure AUROC, latency, cost for each method
3. Create comparison table showing ASV vs baselines

**Validation Criteria**:
- ‚úì ASV matches or beats GPT-4 judge on AUROC (target: ‚â•0.95 to be competitive)
- ‚úì ASV is 10x+ faster than GPT-4 judge (target: <100ms vs ~2s)
- ‚úì ASV is 100x+ cheaper than GPT-4 judge (target: <$0.001 vs ~$0.02)

**Estimated Effort**: 3 days
- Day 1: Implement GPT-4 judge + SelfCheckGPT
- Day 2: Run evaluations on degeneracy benchmark
- Day 3: Analysis + write-up

**Cost**: ~$100 for GPT-4 API calls (937 samples √ó 2 calls √ó $0.05)

**Deliverable**: New Section 6.6 "Comparison to Production Baselines" with Table 12

---

### Priority 2.2: Edge Case Analysis (Adversarial Robustness) ‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Why**: Show the system is not trivially fooled.

**Plan**:
1. Generate 200 adversarial samples (4 attack types, 50 each):
   - **Noise injection**: Add random words to break coherence without loops
   - **Synonym substitution**: Paraphrase loops to evade exact repetition
   - **Format games**: Use punctuation/whitespace to fool tokenizer
   - **Semantic camouflage**: Wrap loops in varied context
2. Measure ASV detection rate on adversarial samples
3. Document failure modes and mitigations

**Validation Criteria**:
- ‚úì Detection rate ‚â• 0.80 on adversarial samples (robust but not perfect)
- ‚úì At least 2 attacks successfully evade detection (honest assessment)
- ‚úì Mitigations proposed for each failure mode

**Estimated Effort**: 2 days

**Deliverable**: New Section 8.2 "Adversarial Robustness" (extends Threat Model)

---

## Phase 3: Real-World Validation (2-3 weeks) üåç

## Phase 4: Theoretical Strengthening (Optional, 1 week) üìê

### Priority 4.1: Formal Proof of r_LZ Optimality for Loops
**Why**: Explain *why* r_LZ achieves perfect detection, not just that it does.

**Plan**:

## Validation Framework: "Will This Be Useful?" üéØ

### Before Starting Any Improvement, Ask:

#### 1. **Impact Questions**
- ‚úì Does this address a reviewer concern? (e.g., heuristic ‚Üí real recomputation)
- ‚úì Does this demonstrate real-world value? (e.g., case study, cost analysis)
- ‚úì Does this differentiate from baselines? (e.g., GPT-4 comparison)
- ‚úì Does this strengthen a weak claim? (e.g., human eval validates "degeneracy")

#### 2. **Feasibility Questions**
- ‚úì Can we complete this in stated timeframe? (avoid scope creep)
- ‚úì Do we have the data/resources? (e.g., access to production systems)
- ‚úì Is the cost justified? (e.g., $100 for GPT-4 API is worth it)
- ‚úì Can we measure success objectively? (quantitative validation criteria)

#### 3. **Publication Strategy**
- ‚úì Does this move the paper toward a specific venue? (e.g., NeurIPS, MLSys, ICML)
- ‚úì Does this address a gap that similar papers have? (learn from related work)
- ‚úì Does this create a "quotable result"? (e.g., "100x cheaper, 10x faster")

## Risk Mitigation üõ°Ô∏è

### Risk 1: Real-world deployment fails to get traction
**Mitigation**: Pursue Option C (public dataset analysis) in parallel. Lower effort, guaranteed data.

### Risk 2: GPT-4 baseline significantly outperforms ASV
**Mitigation**: Reframe as "cost-effective alternative" (100x cheaper). Hybrid approach (ASV ‚Üí escalate to GPT-4).

### Risk 3: Human evaluation shows low agreement
**Mitigation**: Refine degeneracy definition with raters' feedback. Iterate on criteria.

### Risk 4: Adversarial attacks easily evade detection
**Mitigation**: Document failure modes honestly. Propose defenses (future work). Security paper angle.

## Bottom Line: What Will Make This Paper Great? üåü

1. **Real-world validation** (Option A case study) ‚Üí Shows industrial relevance
2. **Cost-benefit analysis** (latency + cost) ‚Üí Shows practical value
3. **Competitive comparison** (GPT-4 baseline) ‚Üí Shows we're not naive
4. **Human validation** (agreement study) ‚Üí Shows we're solving a real problem

**Minimum Viable Improvement**: Do Week 1-2 (Phases 1-2). This adds ~150 lines to paper, 3 new sections, 4 new tables, answers all obvious reviewer questions.

**Optimal Improvement**: Do full 4-week plan. This creates a deployment-ready system with real case study, publishable at top venues.

**Decision Point**: After Week 2, assess:
- If Week 1-2 results are strong (all validation criteria met) ‚Üí Submit to arXiv, start shopping to conferences
- If gaps remain ‚Üí Continue with Week 3-4 (real-world study)

---

## Questions to Answer Before Starting üí≠

1. **Timeline**: Do we have 4 weeks? Or need to submit sooner?
2. **Budget**: Can we spend $100-200 on API calls and MTurk?
3. **Access**: Do we have connections to open-source LLM projects?
4. **Venue**: Which conference is the target? (Determines what matters)
5. **Goal**: Publication? Production deployment? Both?

---

**Next Action**: Choose 1-2 improvements from Phase 1 to start this weekend. Recommend starting with **Priority 1.1 (scale sensitivity)** and **Priority 1.2 (latency/cost)** as they're low-effort, high-impact, and unblock submission.
