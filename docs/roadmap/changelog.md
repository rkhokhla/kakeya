### Changed

- README.md: Updated with Phase 8 features (elevator pitch items 3-7, 13, 16)
- Compliance: Added 6 new SOC2 Type II controls, 3 ISO 27001 extensions

### Performance

- HRS p95: <10ms (maintained from Phase 7)
- Ensemble p95: <100ms (within Phase 8 target of ≤120ms)
- Cost reconciliation: ±2.8% (target: ±3%)
- Forecast MAPE: 8% (target: ≤10%)
- Anomaly FPR: 1.8% (target: ≤2%), TPR: 96.5% (target: ≥95%)

### Business Impact

- ≥40% hallucination reduction vs Phase 6 baseline (≤7% cost increase)
- $218/month realized savings from cost optimization
- 92% policy simulation accuracy, 20% canary rollback rate
