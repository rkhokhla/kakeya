## Design Principles (Maintained Across All Phases)

1. **Backward Compatibility:** No breaking changes to Phase 1 invariants
2. **Fail-Safe Defaults:** Degraded mode preferred over hard failure
3. **Observable:** Every feature has metrics and alerts
4. **Testable:** Unit, integration, E2E, chaos tests for all features
5. **Documented:** Architecture, runbooks, reports for all changes
