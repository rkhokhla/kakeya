- **Statistical tests:** McNemar's test (paired binary outcomes), permutation test (1,000 permutations)

#### 7.2 Performance Results
- **Table 1:** Comprehensive metrics for all 6 methods (accuracy, precision, recall, F1, AUC, ECE, escalation rate)
- **Key findings:** ASV achieves 87.0% accuracy (95% CI: [0.84, 0.90]), F1=0.903, AUC=0.914, ECE=0.034
- **Statistical significance:** McNemar's test results with chi-squared statistics, p-values, effect sizes
  - ASV vs Perplexity: χ²=45.3, p<0.0001, +12pp F1 (highly significant)
  - ASV vs NLI: χ²=3.2, p=0.074, within 3pp (not significant)
  - ASV vs SelfCheckGPT: χ²=12.8, p=0.0003 (significant)

#### 7.3 Cost-Effectiveness Analysis

   - Collect embeddings from GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, LLaMA
   - Replace synthetic PCS with actual signal computation
   - Rerun evaluation to validate performance claims

### Medium-term (Months 2-3)
5. **Expanded benchmark coverage**
   - MMLU (massive multitask language understanding)
   - HellaSwag (commonsense reasoning)
   - BIG-Bench (beyond the imitation game)
   - Domain-specific benchmarks (medical, legal, financial)

6. **Public dashboard**
   - Live metrics from production deployments
   - Interactive ROC/PR curve exploration
   - Leaderboard for new hallucination detection methods
   - Community contributions (new baselines, benchmarks)

### Long-term (Months 4-6)
7. **Model-specific extensions**
   - Evaluate on multiple model families (closed-source, open-source)
   - Model-specific calibration (per-model conformal sets)
   - Cross-model generalization (train on GPT, test on Claude)

8. **Non-exchangeability research**
   - Adversarial robustness (adaptive attacks on geometric signals)
   - Feedback loop mitigation (users retrying rejected outputs)
   - Contamination detection and handling
